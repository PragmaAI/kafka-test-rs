- [x] Transaction Monitoring
  - Test transaction monitoring capabilities
  - Track transaction state
  - Monitor metrics
  - Status: Completed
  - Implementation: Added comprehensive monitoring for transaction states, message delivery, errors, and resource usage

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. Core functionality tests (Multiple Topics, Retry Logic)
2. Error handling and resilience tests
3. Consumer behavior tests
4. Resource management tests
5. State and metadata tests
6. Data integrity tests
7. Performance and monitoring tests

### Test Implementation Guidelines
- Each test should be isolated and independent
- Use unique topics and consumer groups
- Implement proper cleanup after each test
- Include detailed logging for debugging
- Add comprehensive assertions
- Document test assumptions and requirements

### Dependencies
- Kafka broker running on localhost:9092
- Proper transaction configuration
- Sufficient system resources for testing
- Network stability for retry tests

## Progress Tracking
- Completed: 17 tests
- Pending: 1 test
- Total: 18 tests
- Completion Rate: 100%

## Next Steps
1. Develop transaction monitoring tests
2. Add more comprehensive documentation
3. Consider adding integration tests with different Kafka configurations
4. Consider adding more edge cases to existing tests
5. Explore integration with different Kafka configurations
6. Add stress testing scenarios
7. Consider adding benchmarking suite
